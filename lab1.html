    <p> Hi, my name is Ellen Cheong and I am a photographer! <br>
      Photography, for me, began as a way to preserve cherished memories for my parents,but it quickly evolved into <br>
      a deeper exploration of light, composition, and storytelling. As a primarily self-taught photographer with studio experience, <br>
      I have honed my craft through dedication and curiosity. My meticulous attention to detail allows me to create vivid <br>
      and dynamic images that capture the essence of each moment and reveal the innermost beauty of my subjects.
